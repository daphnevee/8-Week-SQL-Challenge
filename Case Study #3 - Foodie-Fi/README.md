# Case Study #3: Foodie-Fi

## Introduction
Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.

## Problem Statement
Danny wants to gather insights about his customers, pertaining to their preferred subscription plan, when they churn, and the time their subscription plan starts in order to make better-informed decisions with regards to future investments and new features to be added to the Foodie-Fi streaming service platform.

### B. Challenge Payment Question <a href="anchor" id="challenge-payment-question"></a>
The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

* monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
* upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
* upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
* once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

Example outputs for this table might look like the following:
| customer_id | plan_id |   plan_name   | payment_date | amount | payment_order |
|:-----------:|:-------:|:-------------:|:------------:|:------:|:-------------:|
