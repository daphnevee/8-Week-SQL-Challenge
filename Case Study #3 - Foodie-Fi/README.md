# Case Study #3: Foodie-Fi

## Introduction
Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.

## Problem Statement
Danny wants to gather insights about his customers, pertaining to their preferred subscription plan, when they churn, and the time their subscription plan starts in order to make better-informed decisions with regards to future investments and new features to be added to the Foodie-Fi streaming service platform.

### A. Customer Journey <a href="anchor" id="customer-journey"></a>

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey. Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!
#### Query:
```sql
SELECT
    x.customer_id,
    y.plan_name,
    y.price,
    x.start_date
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions x
JOIN foodie_fi.plans y
ON x.plan_id=y.plan_id
WHERE x.customer_id BETWEEN 1 AND 8
ORDER BY x.customer_id, y.plan_id;
```
#### Explanation:
To get a clear picture of each customer's onboarding journey, a ```JOIN``` clause was used to combine both the ```subscriptions``` table and the ```plans``` table based on their related column, ```plan_id```, to display the Customer ID and the Start Date details from the ```subscriptions``` table and the Plan Name and Price from the ```plans``` table. *Aliases* were also given, i.e. ```x``` for the ```subscriptions``` table and ```y``` for the ```plans``` table, so as to make the query more readable. In addition to that, a ```WHERE``` clause is applied to filter the results to show only the details for customers with the ID of 1 through 8 given that the new schema appears to have been modified to have a total number of customer records ranging up to 1000 compared to the given table in the instructions for the Case Study. An ```ORDER BY``` statement was then also used to organize the results by default in ascending order according to the Customer ID and the Plan ID.

#### Output:
| customer_id |   plan_name   |  price |        start_date        |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|:------:|:------------------------:|

|      8      |  pro monthly  |  19.90 | 2020-08-03T00:00:00.000Z |

#### Answer:
Based from the output of the query, it can be observed Customer 1 chose to sign up for an initial 7 day free trial of Foodie-Fi's streaming service on the 1st of August. It appears that Customer 1 was satisified with the streaming service because on the 8th of August, after the 7 day free trial, they immediately opted to purchase a basic monthly plan at the price of $9.90. The same behavior can also be observed from Customers 3 and 5 who signed up for the free trial and later purchased a basic monthly plan. Customer 2 also signed up for the initial 7 day free trial on the 20th of September and after a week, at the end of the trial, chose to purchase a pro annual subscription at the price of $199. As for Customers 7 and 8, they signed up for the free trial and after a week, purchased a basic monthly plan. Given that basic monthly customers have limited access to Foodie-Fi's streaming services, both customers decided to upgrade their current subscription plan to a pro monthly plan at the price of $19.90. Pro plan customers, compared to basic monthly plan customers, have no watch time limits and can also download videos for offline viewing. On the other hand, it can be observed that Customers 4 and 6 initially signed up for a free trial and later purchased a basic monthly plan but after a couple of months, they decided to cancel their subscription plan based on their churn plan records.

### B. Data Analysis Questions <a href="anchor" id="data-analysis-questions"></a>
1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
#### Query:
```sql
SELECT  
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_num_customers
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions;
```

#### Explanation:
To determine the total number of customers Foodie-Fi has ever had, a ```COUNT``` aggregate function was used in conjunction with a ```DISTINCT``` clause to count only unique customer records, and to avoid duplicates, in the ```subscriptions``` table. An *alias* of ```total_num_customers``` was given to provide a more descriptive column name for the results.

#### Output:
| total_num_customers |
|:-------------------:|
|         1000        |

#### Answer:
Based from the output of the query, it can be observed that Foodie-Fi has had a total number of 1000 customers since the startup was launched in 2020.

On the other hand, the month of February has the lowest monthly distribution with a total of 68 customer sign-ups.

### C. Challenge Payment Question <a href="anchor" id="challenge-payment-question"></a>
The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

* monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
* upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
* upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
* once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

Example outputs for this table might look like the following:
| customer_id | plan_id |   plan_name   | payment_date | amount | payment_order |
|:-----------:|:-------:|:-------------:|:------------:|:------:|:-------------:|
|      1      |    1    | basic monthly |  2020-08-08  |  9.90  |       1       |
